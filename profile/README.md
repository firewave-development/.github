# Onboarding Instructions

Welcome to Firewave Development! We're excited to have you on board. This guide will help you get started with our onboarding process, including accessing our GitHub organization, using ClickUp for project management, and setting up your company email.

## GitHub Organization Access

1. You should have received an email invitation to join our GitHub organization. If you haven't received it, please email contact@firewave.dev
2. Click on the invitation link in the email to accept the invitation and create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
3. Once you're logged in to GitHub, you'll be redirected to our organization's page. Click on "Join" to become a member.
4. Our team will review and approve your membership request. You'll receive an email notification once approved.

## ClickUp Access

1. You should have also received an email invitation to join our ClickUp workspace. ClickUp is our project management tool where you'll find spaces for each project and collaborate with the team.
2. Click on the invitation link in the email to accept the invitation and create a ClickUp account if you don't have one already.
3. Once you're logged in to ClickUp, you'll see our workspace with different spaces corresponding to various projects.
4. Click on the relevant project space to access it and view the tasks, documents, and discussions related to that project.

## Setting Up Your Company Email

1. As a member of Firewave, you will have a company email address in the format `firstname@firewave.dev`, with `firstname` being your first name. This email will be used for official communication within the organization.
2. These emails are mostly used to stay consistent and easily contact other team memebers. For example, if I want to contact John Smith but don't know his email, I can just use john@firewave.dev and should be good to go.

## Using ClickUp

ClickUp is designed to help us streamline our project management processes. Here's a brief overview of how to use ClickUp effectively:

1. **Spaces**: Each project has its dedicated space in ClickUp. Click on the project space to view and manage its tasks, subtasks, and other project-related details.
2. **Tasks**: Tasks represent specific action items or work units within a project. You can create new tasks, assign them to team members, set due dates, and track progress.
3. **Checklists**: Checklists can be added to tasks to break them down into smaller subtasks. This helps in managing complex tasks and tracking their completion.
4. **Documents**: ClickUp allows you to attach documents to tasks or store project-related documents in the space's Files section. This makes it easy to collaborate and share necessary files.
5. **Discussions**: Discussions provide a platform for team communication and collaboration. You can use comments, mentions, and attachments to discuss project-related topics with team members.
6. **Notifications**: ClickUp provides notifications to keep you informed about task updates, comments, and changes made by team members. You can customize your notification preferences as per your requirements.
